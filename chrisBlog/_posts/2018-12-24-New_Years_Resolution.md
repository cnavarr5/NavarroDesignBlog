New Year, Starting now

I'm Christian Navarro. This blog isn't inteded for anyone in particular, but more of a personal journal that I'm leaving open for the world to see. So here's to a new year, lets get started on my goals. 

The first: TatiandAna.com
My brothers website to sell his boutique jewelery. A boutique site will definitely need to be beautiful, this will help hone my design skills. As it stands, that is the biggest struggle I have. Creativity is one of my weakpoints and making things look good is even more difficult for me. 

The Second: TimeTracker
A project that will track how much time I spend on a given task. It will be a web client with an android companion app. The aim of the project will be to create an easy user experience for a tool that is intended to improve workflow. If I find myself not using it or I find it too hard to impliment into my daily workflow, then it won't be considered complete.
The idea is simple, all I want it to do is to list tasks, mark them as complete, and keep track of how much time I spend on them. It will be useful for my eventual freelance career.

The Third: Undecided
I'm still working on an actual product that I can sell and make money off of. I'm torn between an undisclosed web game within the Tyrotoxic franchise or something completely out of left field. I'm hoping that this will test my skill to create a useful, marketable product that people enjoy. 

Right now, the main things I'm considering is going all in on KtPO(Working title), a card game with characters from the Tyrotoxic franchise. The challenge there would be rolling out a commercial product on a large scale. The challenges their are not quite evident yet, but right now the art would be a challenge for me, as well as creating fun mechanics that people would enjoy, and keeing the performance at a playable level on both mobile and web. But that's the easy stuff, when it comes to hosting a mass market online game, or knowing where to hold it on the web are challenges that I have no idea where to begin. 

The other project would be Buddy.com(working title), a social media site that would allow users to create their own pages that have their own web pages that have whatever they want to share on them, along with their own email, with a buddy.owndomain.com.
